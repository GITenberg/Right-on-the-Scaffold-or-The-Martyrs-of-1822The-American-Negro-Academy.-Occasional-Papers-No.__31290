description: In this volume Grimke tells the story of Denmark Vesey, a freed, literate
  slave and a respected community member of Charleston, South Carolina. Vesey became
  convinced that the slaves were God's chosen people, like the Jews of the Old Testament,
  and led an unsuccessful insurrection against white slaveholders that resulted in
  dramatic trials and executions.
